1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews with balanced positive/negative labels.

Generated key visualizations including sentiment distribution, review length distribution, and word clouds to understand text patterns.

Identified frequent words and text characteristics that differentiate positive and negative sentiment.

2. Implemented NLP Text Preprocessing

Cleaned raw text by removing HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.

Tokenized and normalized reviews to prepare high-quality input for machine learning models.

Converted raw text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization (10,000+ features) for efficient learning.

3. Built and Evaluated Machine Learning Model

Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, a classic NLP algorithm known for high speed and performance on text data.

Achieved strong accuracy (~85–88%) on IMDB sentiment classification.

Evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Classification Report

4. Model Performance Visualization

Visualized classification performance using:

Heatmap confusion matrix

Accuracy bar plot

Classification report heatmap

Interpreted model results, analyzed misclassifications, and identified patterns in model errors.

5. Delivered a Complete End-to-End NLP Pipeline

Built a reproducible workflow covering:

EDA

Preprocessing

Feature extraction

Model training

Visualization

Interpretation

Demonstrated ability to work with large text datasets and apply machine learning effectively.
